questionA:

compilation: g++ -o lab3 lab3.cpp
Execution:./lab3

questionB:
result:
	(1)size=1000
		sort():0seconds
		v1/v2are different.
		insertion_sort():0.01seconds
		v1/v2are the same.
	(2)size=10000
		sort():0seconds
        v1/v2are different.
        insertion_sort():1.3seconds
        v1/v2are the same.
	(3)size=100000
		sort():0.04seconds
        v1/v2are different.
        insertion_sort():128.4seconds
        v1/v2are the same.
	(4)size=1000000
		sort():0.51seconds
        v1/v2are different.
        insertion_sort():	seconds
explanation:
	The way of sort() is obvious faster than insertion_sort().When the size becomes larger,the gap of the time becomes larger.
	The different between n square and nlogn is that the n square(insertion_sort)takes more time than nlogn(sort()).The gap of the time becomes larger,as the n
increasing.
